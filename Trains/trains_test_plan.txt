Test Plan for the Train

Special Equipment : Controller, Cabs, Dallee, Sound_Units, Layout Track, Trains, Terminal, Everything worked on essentially
Goal              : Verify that the trail will run correctly in all senarios taken into consideration
Setup             : Place trains on the track in correct locations.
Implementation    : run Dispatcher.adb
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test. we are testing the edge cases.

Enable_Train
------------
Nothing else will work if this doesn't work
testing the other functions will show that
this is correct.

Is_Triggered
------------
Cross a magnet over the hall sensor and
check if the functions that we have in
the procedure are called.

Hall Sensor   Train-End   What Happens
1             Loco        reserve next block if possible, power block just reached, adjust turnouts if needed, 
1             Caboose     unpower block just left, unreserve block just left    
26            Loco        reserve next block if possible, power block just reached to opposite, adjust turnouts if needed,
26            Caboose     unpower block just left, unreserve block just left  

-------------------------------------- 

Throttle
--------
Increasing the knob on the controller
should increase the speed of the train
that corresponds with the controller.
Smart Throttle implemented aswell.

Throttle-Percent  What Happens  
10                Train starts moving
50                Train is going half speed
100               Train at maximum speed

-------------------------------------

Set_Turnout
-----------
Sets the turnout infront of the train.

Current-Block   Direction-Moving   Set-Turnout-Direction-To  Results (if train can reserve common)
1               Normal             Right                     turnout 6 set to Right
1               Reverse            Right                     turnout 13 set to Right
1               Normal             Left                      turnout 6 set to Left
1               Reverse            Left                      turnout 13 set to Left
35              Normal             Right                     turnout 21 set to Right
35              Reverse            Right                     turnout 9 set to Right
35              Normal             Left                      turnout 21 set to Left
35              Reverse            Left                      turnout 9 set to Left

---------------------------------------

Set_Direction
-------------
Changes the direction the train is moving.

Current-Direction   Time-Waited (seconds)   Results
Normal              1.0                     Normal
Normal              3.0                     Reversed
Reversed            1.0                     Reversed
Reversed            3.0                     Normal
Normal              9000                    Reversed
Reversed            9000                    Normal
-----------------------------------------

Horn
----
Signals the horn when the controllers
button is pressed.

Controller-Number  Result
1                  Train 1 horn
2                  Train 2 horn
3                  Train 3 horn
-------------------------------------

Engineer_Stop
-------------
Signals emergency stop when controller
red button is pressed.

Controller-Number  Result
1                  Train 1 Stopped
2                  Train 2 Stopped
3                  Train 3 Stopped
--------------------------------------

Dispatcher_Request_Stop
-----------------------
Sent from dispatcher to tell train to stop.

Train-Chosen   Result
1              Train 1 Stopped
2              Train 2 Stopped
3              Train 3 Stopped
-------------------------------------------

Dispatcher_Request_Go
---------------------
Sent from dispatcher to tell train to go.

Train-Chosen   Result
1              Train 1 Going
2              Train 2 Going
3              Train 3 Going
-----------------------------------------

Failure_Callback
----------------
When a turnout fails tells train what to do.
Upon hitting a failed turnout the train should
stop.
---------------------------------------------

Recovery_Callback
-----------------
Upon a failed turnouts recovery tells the train what to do.
Upon hitting a failed turnout that has recovered the train
should start up again.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Disable
-------
Resets everything to defaults. Used for reinitialization.


Additional Testing
-------------------
Taking senarios from our notebooks and seeing if the train reacts to
them as expected, this will find to most errors if there are any. 
Most of the tests above are short because most of the packages have
already been tested and we just need to make sure everything is communicating
correctly through the train body.
