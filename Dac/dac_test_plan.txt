Test Plan for the DAC

Special Equipment : Hand Controller
Goal              : Make sure the dac makes the correct conversion
Setup             : None
Implementation    : run dac_test.adb
Expected Results  : Depending on the channel and the volt number, we confirm that the write was a success. Initial volt values on all channels should be 0, and changing one channel's volt value should not affect another channel's volt value.
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test. We will test edge cases for each channel.

For each channel:
	Confirm that initial value is 0
	Set value to 5
	Set value to 0
	Set value to -5
	Confirm that all channels stayed on their assigned value without being impacted by a write to another channel
