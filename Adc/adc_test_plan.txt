Test Plan for the ADC

Special Equipment : Hand Controller
Goal              : Make sure the ADC body reads the correct value From the hand controller
Setup             : None
Implementation    : run adc_test.adb
Expected Results  : depending on the amount the knob is turned the the value will be outputed to the screen between between 0 and +5 volts
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test. we are testing the edge cases.
Edge Cases        : knob fully to the left
		    knob fully to the right
		    knob in the middle
		    Knob half way between middle and left
		    Knob half way between middle and right

knob location		 	expected Volt output (roughly)
fully left			 0    volts
fully right			 5    volts
middle				 2.5  volts
between left and middle		 1.25 volts
between right and middle	 3.75 volts
