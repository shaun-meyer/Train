Test Plan for the Hall Sensor

Special Equipment : Hall Sensor, magnet
Goal              : Make sure that a sensor is triggered by a magnet, and that the program can disable and enable interrupts sent from the sensor
Setup             : Initialize the hall sensors
Implementation    : run halls_test.adb
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test. We will be testing all states for a single sensor. 
			To test enabling of interrupts, we will be supplying a simple procedure that prints to the screen

Is_Triggered
Magnet is off of sensor => False
Magnet is on sensor     => True
Remove magnet again     => False

Enable
Call enable procedure
Magnet is on sensor     => Callback procedure is called
                           True
Magnet is off sensor    => False
Return magnet to sensor => Callback procedure is called
                           True

Disable
Call disable procedure
Magnet is on sensor     => No procedure called
                           True
Magnet is off sensor    => No procedure called
                           False
Return magnet to sensor => No procedure called
                           True

We will apply this test to numerous different sensors.
