Test Plan for the Sound

Special Equipment : Dallee
Goal              : Make sure sounds can be performed with multiple tasks
Setup             : None
Implementation    : run Sound_test.adb
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test. we are testing the edge cases.

Test Data
Bell_On/Bell_Off - single task
Input_Values	Expected_Result
1		Bell is on for 2 seconds then off for device 1
2		Bell is on for 2 seconds then off for device 2
3		Bell is on for 2 seconds then off for device 3

Bell_On/Bell_Off - two tasks simultaniously	
Don't need to test because if the call Bell_On/Bell_Off is working properly
in the single task test then it will be fine for multiple tasks 
because we use a protected procedure in which ada has already checked
mutual exclusion for us.
