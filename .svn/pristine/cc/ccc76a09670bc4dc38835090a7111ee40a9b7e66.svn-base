Test Plan for the Layout.Search
Test will be run by executing the searching algorithm, and comparing expected results vs actual.
Expected results will be obtained by hardcoding in test values, based on an examination of the map.
This test cannot be run exhaustively, as there are thousands of different possibilities.
Instead, the border cases will be run: distance of 0, distance of 1, medium distance, and large distance.
It was also test for special cases, such as a turnout that leads to a turnout.
The test should handle all of these cases. 
In the situation of multiple paths on the layout, the algorithm should find all of them.
