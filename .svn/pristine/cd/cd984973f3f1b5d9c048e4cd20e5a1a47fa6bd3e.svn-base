Test Plan for the Block

Special Equipment : Cabs, 82C55 Chip
Goal              : Make sure the Block is set correctly
Setup             : None
Implementation    : run Block_test.adb
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test. we are testing the edge cases.

Connect_Cab
After connecting a cab, you can then check the polarity for a block
Cab_ID		Polarity	Block_ID	expected output to screen
1		Normal		1		for all Normal the light will go from dim green to bright green
2		Normal		12		
3		Normal		13		
4		Normal		24		
5               Normal          25    
6		Normal   	36		
1               Reserved    1   for all reversed the light will go from dim red to bright red
2               Reserved    12 
3               Reserved    13 
4               Reserved    24 
5               Reserved    25 
6               Reserved    36 

Reserve and UnReserve are tested against each other. Reserve's boolean result will show whether UnReserved worked

Reserve
Train_ID	Block	Success
1		1	True
1               1       True
2               1       False

UnReserve
Block_ID	Request_ID      Expected
1		1               Reserve is decremented by 1

Reserve
Train_ID	Block	Success
2		1	False

UnReserve
Block_ID    Request_ID      Expected
1           1               Reserve is decremented by 1, putting it at 0. Block is connected to null cab
This will be shown by whether or not the block is lit up

Reserve
Train_ID        Block   Success
2               1       True
2               1       True
2               1       True

Unreserve       
Block_ID     Request_ID      Expected
1            2               Reserve is decremented by 1
1            0               Reserve is set to 0, ligh switches off
