Test Plan for the Layout.Search

Special Equipment : None
Goal              : Assert that the result of the Layout.Search's algorithm produces the same results as can be examined on the map
Setup             : None
Implementation    : run test_layout_search.adb
Expected Results  : Expect that all values returned by the test program, when given the starting and ending blocks of the train, match the blocks and turnouts that exist between the given blocks
Testing Method    : This is not an exhaustive test, as there are thousands of possibilites. Instead, we are testing the edge cases.
Edge Cases        : 2 Block Beneath 0 Turnout
                    3 Block Beneath 0 Turnout
                    2 Block Beneath 1 Turnout
                    3 Block Beneath 1 Turnout
                    2 Block Beneath 2 Turnout
                    3 Block Beneath 2 Turnout	
                    2 Block Beneath 3 Turnout
                    3 Block Beneath 3 Turnout
                    3 Block Beneath 4 Turnout
